# Blender_UEXP
Creates a mesh in blender from a uexp (UnrealEngine) to allow for edits, then writes modifications back into the uexp.

## This is all still very experimental and early in development, not intended for common usage. Use at your own risks.


### How to use
- Install the addon using Blender addon installer in User Preferences
- Go in Scene properties and find the Uexp Panel
- Select a Uexp path using the browser (disable RelativePath in the browser settings)
- Click Search Vertex Offset
- Import the desired LOD
- Make your edits
- Export the desired LOD
