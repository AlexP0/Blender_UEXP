# Blender_UEXP
Creates a mesh in blender from a uexp (UnrealEngine) to allow for edits, then writes modifications back into the uexp.

## This is all still very experimental and early in development, not intended for common usage. Use at your own risks.


### How to use
- Copy the code in blender's text editor
- Change the Uexp path in the code
- Click Run Script
- Go in Scene properties and find the Uexp Panel
- Click Search Vertex Offset
- Import the desired LOD (Export is out of service atm)
