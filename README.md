# Blender_UEXP
Creates a mesh in blender from a uexp (UnrealEngine) to allow for edits, then writes modifications back into the uexp.

## This is all still very experimental and early in development, not intended for common usage. Use at your own risks.


### How to use
- Copy the code in blender's text editor
- Edit the Uexp path and VertexBegin, VertexEnd
- Manually write the function you want to call CreateMesh() or WriteMesh()
- Click RunScript
- Blender will become unresponsive for a bit, no worries. The bigger the file, the longer it'll freeze.
- You can toggle blender's System Console and uncomment some prints to see what it's doing.

### Permissions
Anyone is free to contribute to the project. Just ask for invite.
